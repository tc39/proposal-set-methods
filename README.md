# Set Methods for JavaScript

This is a proposal to add methods like union and intersection to JavaScript's built-in `Set` class.

**It is currently at stage 4: it has been [added to the specification](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/3306). This repository is no longer active.**

Original readme follows.

## Proposal

This would add the following methods:

  * `Set.prototype.intersection(other)`
  * `Set.prototype.union(other)`
  * `Set.prototype.difference(other)`
  * `Set.prototype.symmetricDifference(other)`
  * `Set.prototype.isSubsetOf(other)`
  * `Set.prototype.isSupersetOf(other)`
  * `Set.prototype.isDisjointFrom(other)`

These methods would all require their arguments to be a Set, or at least something which looks like a Set in terms of having a numeric `size` property as well as `keys` and `has` methods.

See [details.md](./details.md) for details of current decisions made in this proposal.

Rendered spec text is available [here](https://tc39.es/proposal-set-methods/).

The proposal was originally authored by [Micha≈Ç Wadas](https://github.com/Ginden) and later championed by [Sathya Gunasekaran](https://github.com/gsathya) and [Kevin Gibbons](https://github.com/bakkot).

## Implementations

This proposal is ready for engines to implement and ship. See [this issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-set-methods/issues/78) for current status.

## Comparison with other languages

See [other languages document](./other-languages.md) to get overview of `Set` methods in other languages.

## Naming

See [naming bikeshedding](./name-bikeshedding.md) document for details.

We decided to choose:

* **Symmetric difference** - **`symmetricDifference`**
* **Intersection** - **`intersection`**
* **Union** - **`union`**
* **Difference** - **`difference`**
